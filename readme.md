# Javascript Landing page
## Interface and Architecture
My project main goal is to create a  landing page that 
has the following features. 
1. All features  are usable across modern tablet and phone browsers. 
2. Page structure has a hierarchical structure, and nesting all relevant files in the same folder. 
3. There is  at least 4 sections 
4. Navigation is built dynamically using Javascript as a unordered list. In this project i used the forEach() method and used an Array, and arguments  created the element and assigning  the anchor tag to the respective nested tag. 
## Landing page Behavior
1. Added scrolling functionality to highlight the current section and nav-item. i used getBoundingClientRect() for this along with the suggested helper function. I created a If/else statement after to create the nav underline(border) and h2 highlight. 
2.Created another forEach()  click function. using ScrollTop(). Also, adding HTML smooth scroll for a smoother scroll. Also adding preventDefault() to prevent the default action. Unless explicit defined.
## Documentation
1. Created Readme.md, explaining my rubric and methods i took with each requirement. 
2. created comments to navigate easier through code. also easier to come back after breaks. 
3. code is formatted to my best ability per style guide.
